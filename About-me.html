                <p>Hello! I am Adolfo Bustos and I am 31 years old. I am currently studying the "University Technician
                    in Computer Application Development" at UNICEN.
                    Previously, in
                    2015, I studied "Integral Production in Audiovisual Arts". Which I left pierced by new interests and
                    expectations,
                    but grateful for the experience acquired. I have a fluent English level. I am in continuous training
                    and practice
                    to improve my
                    fluency when speaking.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I consider myself a flexible person, with the ability to learn and adapt to changes. Interested in
                    constantly
                    training to learn about new development technologies. I like to read, listen to music, enjoy nature.
                    My great passion is photography, the way I choose to
                    observe and
                    capture moments in my day to day.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I am currently looking to work and join new challenges that allow me to continue growing personally
                    and
                    professionally, developing and expanding my knowledge. I am open to the possibility of changing my
                    destination, discovering new horizons. In relation to a new job, I am interested in participating in
                    front-end development projects mainly,
                    although I have
                    knowledge of Full Stack.</p>
                <br>
                <p>To the company that offers me an opportunity, I want to be able to demonstrate that I am capable of
                    achieving what I
                    set my mind to and repay the trust placed in it. I am available full time to start work or train
                    online.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Over the years, I developed my communication skills and learned to resolve situations that came my
                    way. My most recent job was the development of the professional website of Sofia Mosqueda, whom I
                    thank
                    for trusting me. My experiences making short films taught me to work as a team, having good
                    communication and active
                    listening.
                    Understanding that each member can add from their place, achieving a much more productive
                    development. I consider it important to respect others and inspire confidence. I value each
                    experience, because it
                    is one more
                    step in my personal growth.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Thanks for taking the time to read about me. Browsing this site you can learn more about my training,
                    experience and
                    see my designs. I remain at your entire disposal, to expand as much information as you deem
                    necessary.</p>
